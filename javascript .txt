Javascript 
-------------
JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex
features on web pages 

  Syntax
  -------
    var x = 5; // Declaring a variable (old way)
    let y = 10; // Declaring a variable with block scope
    const z = 15; // Declaring a constant

    // Variable types are not explicitly declared

Variable declaration Syntax
----------------------------
  *var variableName = value;
  *let variableName = value;
  *const constantName = value;

Variable
--------
   In JavaScript, variables are used to store and manipulate data.
   syntax for declaring variables:
     var variableName = value;
   Variables declared with var are function-scoped or globally-scoped.
   They can be re-declared and updated within their scope.

DataType
---------
 In Javascript, there are five basic, or primitive, types of data. The five most basic
 types of data are strings, numbers, booleans, undefined, and null.
   Integer (int) It is the most common numeric data type used to store numbers
Operator
--------
Operators are the symbols between values that allow different operations like addition,
subtraction, multiplication, and more.
     *The Assignment Operator = assigns values

     *The Addition Operator + adds values

String
-------
String method returns a string containing the source text segment which was used to define the
function. JavaScript calls the toString method automatically when a Function is to be represented as
a text value,
    Strings are for storing text
    Strings are written with quotes

Function
---------
A function in JavaScript is similar to a procedureâ€”a set of statements that performs a
task or calculates a value, but for a procedure to qualify as a function, it should take
some input and return an output where there is some obvious relationship between the input
and the output.
 Function Return
 ----------------
   When JavaScript reaches a return statement, the function will stop executing.
   If the function was invoked from a statement, JavaScript will "return" to execute the code after the invoking statement.
   Functions often compute a return value. The return value is "returned" back to the "caller":

Flow of Control statement
-------------------------
Control flow statements, however, break up the flow of execution by employing
decision making, looping, and branching, enabling your program to conditionally
execute particular blocks of code.
   If, Else, Else if
   Switch

Loop in JavaScript
------------------
Loops are used in JavaScript to perform repeated tasks based on a condition.
Conditions typically return true or false . A loop will continue running until
the defined condition returns false 
   for loop
   do-while loop

Array
-------
An array in JavaScript is a type of global object that is used to store data.
Arrays consist of an ordered collection or list containing zero or more data types,
and use numbered indices starting from 0 to access specific items
      *int arr[n]; 2D Arrays: int arr[m][n];

Event
--------
An event is an action that occurs as per the user's instruction as input and gives
the output in response. We can consider different types of inputs, such as mouse clicks,
button presses, and when users press tab and text box change.

Location object
---------------
JavaScript Location is a built-in Interface (object type) which represents the location
(URL) of the object to which it is attached. Both the Window object and the Document object have this property

Form object
-----------
Form object is a Browser object of JavaScript used to access an HTML form.
If a user wants to access all forms within a document then he can use the forms array.
The form object is actually a property of document object that is uniquely created by the
browser for each form present in a document.

Form Validation
---------------
JavaScript provides facility to validate the form on the client-side so data processing
will be faster than server-side validation. Most of the web developers prefer JavaScript
form validation. Through JavaScript, we can validate name, password, email, date, mobile
numbers and more fields.
